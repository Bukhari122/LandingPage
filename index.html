  <h1>Crew Poisitions</h1>

</div>

<div class="card-container">
    <div class="card"><strong>Navigator</strong>The navigator is responsible for charting the ship's course, using maps, stars, and the compass to guide the crew safely through treacherous waters.</div>
    <div class="card"><strong>Helmsman</strong>The helmsman steers the ship, keeping it on the navigator's chosen course. They handle the ship's wheel, adjusting for wind and current, and respond quickly during battles or stormy seas.</div>
    <div class="card"><strong>Musician</strong>The musician keeps the crew's spirits high during long voyages with shanties and tunes. They set the rhythm for rowing, entertain during mealtimes, and keep morale up even in the harshest conditions.</div>
    <div class="card"><strong>Ship-Docter</strong>The ship doctor, often a skilled surgeon or herbalist, treats injuries and illnesses among the crew. They handle battle wounds, scurvy, and other ailments, using whatever supplies are available.</div>

<div class="quote">


<p>"Aye, lads, the sea be a fickle mistress – cruel as the devil’s maw yet fair as a summer breeze. She’ll test your steel, break your bones, and carve her mark upon your soul. But mark me words, there be no greater freedom than the wind in your sails and the endless horizon callin’ your name." - Asmodeus</p>
